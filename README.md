The project begins with a welcome message that welcomes the user and gives an overview of the program.
Next the program takes input from the user to see how many pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters, half-dollar and dollar coins they have.
There is a simple check in the program to make sure the user enters a valid amount of coins.
Once all the inputs have been take in the program uses simple addition and multiplication functions to add the total value of all the coins
The program displays the total back to the user.
